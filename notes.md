# Git is not what you think

Git is an onion

Git is a Distributed Version Control System

Git is a Content Tracker

Git is a Map, a Persistent map in your disk

Git stores everything under `.git` directory

Git is a map, where keys are SHA1 hashes and values are objects, objects stored in `.git/objects`

To see what an object contains, use `git cat-file` passing at least one argument, the hash code of the object.

That is the way to see Git as a Map

Let's see it as a content tracker
